                <h5>THE STUDY</h5>
                You will be asked to fill out a survey either online or
                over the telephone to see if you are suitable for the
                study. If you qualify and are interested in participating,
                you will be scheduled for two study visits.

    <b>On the first visit,</b> you will answer questions about your medical history and general health habits,
    have a brief physical exam, and an exercise test to see if you can tolerate moderate exercise and
    how fit you are. If you are eligible based on your test results, and would still like to participate, a
    computer program will assign you by chance to one of the following groups:

            Participants in this group will
            have a 45-minute bout of exercise on a stationary
            bike in the Fred Hutch exercise facility.

    <b>At the second visit,</b> you will be asked to provide blood samples before and after the exercise bout or
    resting control period. We will also ask participants if they are willing to join an optional add-on study
    which involves a muscle biopsy before and after the exercise bout or resting control period.

            who will take them through a sample
